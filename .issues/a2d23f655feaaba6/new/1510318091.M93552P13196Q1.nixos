Subject: Make foo/index.html work
Message-Id: <a2d23f655feaaba6-0-artemis@nixos>

Pages like projects/index.html (and therefore projects/) don't seem to
render properly. It looks like they should redirect to their respective
pages (e.g. /projects.html).

Maybe we shouldn't have an index.html in the source, and should instead
use Nix to generate these redirects?
