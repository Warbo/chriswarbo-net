Subject: Remove 'rendered' from tests
Message-Id: <8dbe4d5e1edc068b-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Our test scripts have been left unchanged from when we used to use Make
and output files to rendered/. We're now running them during a Nix
build, and setting up a rendered/ directory especially. This is just an
overcomplication, so tweak the tests to stop using rendered/ and remove
it from the Nix code.
