Look through blog for little snippets of programming wisdom, functions
(forEach/map/reduce/etc.) are more modular, composable and declarative
than loops; iterators are bad OOP (sequential coupling); "reprogrammable
semicolon"; etc.

Keep them where they are, but also write up a less ranty, more
explanatory form for this new section.
