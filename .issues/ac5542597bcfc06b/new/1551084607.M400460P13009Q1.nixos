Subject: We're getting self-closing script tags
Message-Id: <ac5542597bcfc06b-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

HTML script tags cannot be self-closing, i.e. '<script src="..." />' is
not allowed. It should be '<script src="..."></script>' instead.

Something (pandoc?) is giving out these self-closing script tags, and
that is messing up the resulting pages.
