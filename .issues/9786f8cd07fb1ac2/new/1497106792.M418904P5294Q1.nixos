Subject: One IPNS key per git repo
Message-Id: <9786f8cd07fb1ac2-0-artemis@nixos>

Set up an IPNS key for each repo contained in /git. This should include:

 - A test which ensures each repo has a key
 - Giving each repo a key
 - Deciding how to relate keys to repos: just use repo name (sans .git)?
 - Backing up keys to private storage on several devices
