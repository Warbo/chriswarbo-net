Subject: Use 'vars' arg of render more
Message-Id: <965ba253d36bb8db-0-artemis@nixos>

The Nix 'render' function lets us pass in 'vars', which will be put in
the environment when rendering. We should use this to do things like
making the blog/ dir available to blog.html, etc.

Currently we're using 'attrsToDirs' to build up a directory, but we
could use this instead.
