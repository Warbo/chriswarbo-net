Subject: Hash SK definitions to form a Merkle Tree
Message-Id: <a05f8b534ffc0fe6-0-artemis@manjaro-arm>

Might need a Rust function or something to implement the hashing. Question is
how to serialise children in a sensible way.
Might benefit from merge function in egglog, e.g. to pick one with smallest AST.
Would cause cascading updates, but that might be a good thing.
