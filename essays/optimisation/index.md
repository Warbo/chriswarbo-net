title: Optimisation Algorithms in Javascript
---
Optimisation is the problem of finding the 'best' solution to a problem as quickly as possible. These pages demonstrate a few optimisation algorithms using Javascript:

- [Enumeration](enumeration.html)
- [Random Walk](randomwalk.html)
- [Self-avoiding Random Walk](selfavoidingwalk.html)
- [Tabu Search](tabu.html)
- [Levy Flight](levy.html)
- [Hill-climbing](hillclimbing.html)
- [Hill-climbing Levy Flight](levyclimbing.html)
- [Levin Search](levin.html)
- [Genetic Algorithm with Mutation](mutation.html)
- [Genetic Algorithm with Crossover](crossover.html)
- [Genetic Algorithm with Mutation and Crossover](mutatingcrossover.html)
