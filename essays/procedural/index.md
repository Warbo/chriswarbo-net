title: Procedural Pictures
---

I've been playing with procedurally-generated images recently; here are some interesting ones. All functions `f`{.haskell} are mapped over the pixels, taking in the x and y coordinates as bytes and returning a byte for the colour (a byte is a list of 8 `Bool`{.haskell}s).

 - [One Bits](ones.html)
 - [Z-curve](z.html)
 - [Cantor Tuples](cantor.html)
