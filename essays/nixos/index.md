title: NixOS
---

I'm very interested in the Nix package manager, NixOS Linux distribution and the
ecosystem that's emerging around them.

I [switched to NixOS](switching_to_nixos.html) in 2014, after happily using
Debian for more than a decade. Whenever I tried anything else, I'd always end up
crawling back to Debian, due to its fantastic package manager.

In Nix and its offspring, I think I've finally found something to beat Debian.
I've been transitioning to using Nix and NixOS day in, day out, and have also
been [incorporating it into my software](developing_on_nixos.html), for the
reliability and cross-platform goodness it provides.
