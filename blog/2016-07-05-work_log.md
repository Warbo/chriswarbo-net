Gave up trying to get declarative projects in Hydra. I'll wait for it to get bumped in nixpkgs.

Seemed to fix hsConfig; at least it's building a bunch of stuff!

The `haskell-builds` tests were looping through different sets of haskell packages (`ghc783`, `ghc784`, etc.) and different nixpkgs sets (`stable`, `<nixpkgs>`, etc.) to ensure everything builds with everything. This is a job suited to Hydra.

Some difficulties accessing paths across machines, etc. Trying to solve by making heavier use of `src`, rather than relying on variables, etc.
