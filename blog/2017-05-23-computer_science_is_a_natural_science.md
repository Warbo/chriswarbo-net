title: Computer Science is a Natural Science
---

Many people don't think of Computer Science as a natural science, in the same
sense as Physics, Chemistry, etc. I think this is flat out wrong, and don't
understand why people might think this; for example, my undergraduate degree was
Physics with CS, and people often told me that's a "strange combination".

Some examples of CS being a natural science:

 - Strong/physical Church-Turing thesis: treats the Church-Turing thesis (one of
   the founding ideas of CS) as a physical law, which places strict limits on
   the behaviour of any physical system, namely that it must be computable by a
   Turing machine. Some call this "unproven", but no physical law is "proven";
   relativity, gravitation, thermodynamics, etc. are all experimentally tested
   and theoretically sound; so is the physical Church-Turing thesis.
 - Information theory is a core part of CS, and is also a fundamental part of
   nature, with deep connections to probability (the outcome of a 50/50 event is
   precisely 1 bit), thermodynamics (entropy; Maxwell's Demon; etc.), causality
   (the speed limit in relativity only applies to information transfer), quantum
   mechanics (non-classical probability using complex numbers; entanglement ==
   mutual information; observation == information transfer), black hole
   information paradox, holographic principle, etc.
 - Algorithmic information theory is a very nice way to quantify and compare
   scientific theories, by treating them as programs which output observations.
 - Computational complexity theory places further restrictions on the behaviour
   of physical systems. Similar to the physical Church-Turing thesis, we can
   regard "no system can perform NP-hard calculations using polynomial
   resources" as a theoretically sound, empirically tested law of physics.
 - CS principles provide straightforward, rigorous, objective explanations to
   longstanding problems in science, like free will (computational
   irreducibility), wavefunction collapse (information transfer), mind/body
   duality (hardware/software), and so on. Unfortunately, many don' see CS as a
   natural science, and hence don't encounter its perspectives/explanations, and
   instead repeat the same old woo (quantum consciousness, multiverses,
   anthropic arguments, etc.)
