Desktop offline; will need to sort it.

Multiple output derivations seem to work fine. Need to do a little parsing, e.g. for `failed` and `time`.

Desktop was asking for SSH passphrase for tunnel. Used `ssh-agent` to avoid that in future.

Moving tests into `testDrvs` as and when they fail. Makes running tests much easier/faster.
