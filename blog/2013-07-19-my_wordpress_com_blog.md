title: My Wordpress.com Blog
---
I was reading [Robert Harper's blog] [1] on [wordpress.com] [2] today, tried to comment but apparently I need a wordpress.com login, a twitter.com login or a facebook.com login.

Since [Wordpress] [3] is [Free Software] [4] I made a wordpress.com account, as the lesser of three evils. However, I couldn't complete the registration process without actually creating a wordpress.com blog of my own.

Hence I am now the proud owner of my own, never-going-to-post-anything [Wordpress.com blog] [5]!
