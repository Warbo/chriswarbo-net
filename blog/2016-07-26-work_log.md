`haskell-te` now evaluates on Hydra, if we only include (say) 1 test. The `annotateTipBenchmarks` test also built too.

Enabling *all* tests ran out of memory. Maybe we should use NixOS on bare metal, rather than juggling all of these VMs?

Installed NixOS on desktop to try avoiding these complications. Seems to be running fine; we'll see if it gets memory errors too....

NOTE: `x86_64` Nix is happy to build `i686` packages; no need for separate build slave.
