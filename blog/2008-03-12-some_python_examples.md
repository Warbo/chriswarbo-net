title: Some Python Examples
---
Hello, been working on some tiny Python scripts to show off the bindings and stuff.

Here's the first of them:

<a href="/git/python-examples/branches/master/Scribble/scribble.py.raw.html">Scribble</a> - This simply makes a window in which you can scribble with the mouse

<a href="/git/python-examples/branches/master/Microblogger/server.py.raw.html">Microblogger</a> - This listens on a Jabber account for incoming messages, then publishes them on a web page
