title: Some Python Examples
---
Hello, been working on some tiny Python scripts to show off the bindings and stuff.

Here's the first of them:

## [Scribble](/git/python-examples/git/branches/master/Scribble/scribble.py.raw.html) ##

This simply makes a window in which you can scribble with the mouse.

## [Microblogger](/git/python-examples/git/branches/master/Microblogger/server.py.raw.html) ##

This listens on a Jabber account for incoming messages, then publishes them on a
web page.
