title: PubSubClient back in development
---
I've been messing around with my pubsubclient library again, and the issue with publishing now appears to be fixed (either thanks to me or thanks to the ejabberd team if it was a bug in the server).<br /><br />Anyway, it's working again, and it's now an opportunity to get more reply handlers and documentation written. Since I'm currently in the middle of my exam period this obviously should not be a full-steam-ahead effort, but I'm going to keep chipping away at the TODO list (which is now formalised into a not-yet-up-to-date SPEC-COMPLIANCE file). It's now just a case of putting in the work, since it's not hard thought involved, it's just extracting data from XML and putting it into sensible, pure Python representations.<br /><br />The website is still around at http://pubsubclient.sourceforge.net/ and the code is still on GitHub at http://github.com/Warbo/pubsubclient/tree/master<br /><br />Enjoy :)
