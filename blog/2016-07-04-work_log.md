Investigated Hydra declarative builds; fixed some minor issues getting te-benchmarks to work 'standalone' (which, in turn, is needed to make haskell-te run on Hydra).

Hydra not building for various reasons; `infinite recursion` in one place.

Looking to make nix-build work the same as Hydra.

Trying to build for 'declarative jobsets' support.

Made a few new commands, e.g. `hot` and `test_results`.

`connect_to_tunnel` may need `ssh-add ...` first.
