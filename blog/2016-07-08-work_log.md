Added a bunch more haskell [ackages to Hydra; tried adding everything (custom), but failed to evaluate. Tried ignoring `lts*` and it worked; but we don't *really* care about GHC 6.*, GHC 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, GHCjs, etc. Now limited it to GHC 7.8.4, 7.10.2, 7.10.3, 8.0.1 and GHC_HEAD.

Added non-Haskell packages to Hydra too. We'll see if they work... Each Haskell version adds a slowdown, i.e. it can take ~1 hour to build the first package for a Haskell version; after that, deps are shared.

Split up `test.nix` of haskell-te so we can access the results of each `tests/*.nix` file individually.

Made a `release.nix` file which simply spits this set out; we'll see how Hydra likes it.

Hopefully we can split up the tests even more, so that each file doesn't just return a boolean, but a set of all tests it's run.

Added an i686 build slave by setting `system` to `i686-linux` in an extra entry of build machines in `hydra-master`.
