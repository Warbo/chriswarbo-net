Looked through hydra source and found command used to evaluate jobsets. Using a `nix-shell` sheband, to get the hydra package, we can run this locally without having a Hydra server running (it doesn't use the DB). Made `check.sh` do this.

We were getting an infinite recursion error due to `withNix` trying to look up `NIX_REMOTE` using `runScript` instead of `runCommand` (`runScript` is our wrapper around `runCommand`, which uses `withNix`!)

Now it seems we have 2 problems:

 - Files/strings referring to other paths. Might be solved with `builtins.storePath` and/or `passAsFile`. This is really the eval/build distinction.
 - Can hydra do dynamic imports, e.g. `import (runCommand ...).outPath`?
 - `NIX_REMOTE` gets invalid error on server, but not locally. Investigate after the above.
