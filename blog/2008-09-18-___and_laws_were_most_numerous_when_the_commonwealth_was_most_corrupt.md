title: ...And Laws Were Most Numerous When The Commonwealth Was Most Corrupt

Personally, I would say that power corrupts more than <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7613575.stm">TV</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7621823.stm">miniskirts</a> or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7622793.stm">saggy jeans</a>.<br /><br />I do, however, completely agree with Nsaba Buturo's statement "What's wrong with a miniskirt? You can cause an accident because some of our people are weak mentally,". He could've given an example if there was a mirror nearby.
