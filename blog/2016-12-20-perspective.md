title: Perspective
---

There's a saying that Englishmen think 100 miles is a long way, and Americans
think 100 years is a long time. That came to mind while I was watching
[this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_autor_why_are_there_still_so_many_jobs)
about the impact of automation on the availability of jobs.

Whilst I don't disagree with the overall message, I found it disconcerting how
casually the speaker refers to the 19th century as "the ancient past", and acts
as if the alarmist predictions from that time didn't come true (i.e. assuming
that they were made so long ago that we can definitively call them wrong; rather
than treating them as contemporary views on continuing trends).

The speaker praises the USA's investment in high schools during the transition
from an agricultural to an industrial economy. By these standards, [my own high
school](http://sandbachschool.org) was already "ancient" by the time the USA
itself was founded!
