title: Ridiculousness

I've probably misspelled that title, but oh well. I am currently jumping through a few rather hilariously unfortunate hoops, which is making my life full of trips to banks and less full of heavy drinking and partying.<br /><br />I have, however, managed to categorise pretty much every idea on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IdeaPool">Ubuntu IdeaPool Wiki page</a>, it now just needs someone to go through removing redundant info (and adding those removals to the IdeaPoolHistory page), and to check for existing specs and things. I personally need to go back through a load of my edits and document each removal on the IdeaPoolHistory page (which I didn't know existed before).<br /><br />My Programming in C course started today, which seems pretty good. I know that from a summer of teaching myself Python I'm going to get pissed off by semicolons and squiggly brackets :P C should be good to learn though, from a low-level and a speed perspective. The lecturer's nice (the guy who interviewed me on the Physics Department open day) and GCC is being used in the backend so there should be no problems getting my programs to run on Ubuntu.<br /><br />I'm currently in Access Space (I thought James would be in today, but apparently he's not and he will be tomorrow. Yes Harriet, you were right :P ) so I thought I might as well add a blog entry. The place'll be closing soon, so I think I'll head straight to the Student Union and go to a Pagan Society metting (and hopefully suprise Harriet).<br /><br />Oh well, got to go. Bye :)<br /><br />PS: I need to file some user interface bugs for cash machines, some are just egregious.
