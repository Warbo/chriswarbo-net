Deleted a whole bunch of code, including `order-deps`, `ML4HSFE` and `ml4hsfe-loop` commands, since `ml4hsfe-outer-loop` makes them obsolete. Also deleted tabulation and plotting code, as it was far too specific to previous requirements.

Improved memory usage of HS2AST, AstPlugin and ML4HSFE, by profiling and eliminating `String` in favour of `ByteString` and `Text`.

Tried various combinations of Haskell compiler and package set versions to see if there are more consistent sets. Looks like the `ghc7103` set is the most stable/integrated right now (even more than LTS).
