title: Moving Git Repos
---

For the past 7 years, I've been using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to look after as many of my files as possible (software, writing, system configuration, documents, etc.) and I've been using [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org) to provide an online interface to these repositories.

Gitorious has recently been bought by [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), who's hosting site runs on proprietary software. For this reason, I'm now hosting all of my git repositories [on my own site](/projects/repos). I'll try to keep these URLs stable, so feel free to clone them or update your remotes. You can send me patches using [Git's built-in email support](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email).

In time, I will give each repo a proper page on this site, most probably based on their READMEs.
