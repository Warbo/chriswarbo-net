title: Christmas Is Coming
---
OK, I haven't updated for a while, but I've had a lot of deadlines to get past.<br /><br />So, what has happened in the last month?<br /><br />Firstly the <a href="http://fss.union.shef.ac.uk">FSS</a> has run another installfest. I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> on a laptop, filled a portable hard drive with <a href="http://www.portableapps.com">Windows applications</a> and Arthur went on a quest to distribute <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> CDs and biscuits. Was enjoyable :)<br /><br />Next year the <a href="http://fss.union.shef.ac.uk/forum">FSS</a> should be hosting some <a href="http://www.sheflug.co.uk/">Sheffield LUG</a> meetings (hopefully, if I can sort out room bookings), the ReFreshers fair is coming up (now that we actually have some active members :) ), Arthur has convinced a local computer shop to let him install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on their systems (dual booting with Windows) and there is also some<br />talk about the Music dpeartment getting more Free Software and some <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/index.jsp">Sun Microsystems</a> collaborationy demonstrationy thing. Looks like I'll have my hands full until I hand over power sometime in May<br />:D<br /><br />On a personal note I am off to Sandbach soon (maybe even later this evening), and I don't know when I'll be back in Sheffield (probably sooner rather than later. Sheffield > Sandbach). I am (slowly) learning how to use <a href="http://www.clutter-project.org">Clutter</a> (from within <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>), and hope to get my music visualiser tool to use it (BTW, the link from my old blog post is a pretty old version. It's had quite a few improvements since).<br /><br />I am trying to make a physics engine, which is proving quite challenging, which I hope to make efficient enough to do some kind of <a href="http://www.laptop.org">OLPC</a> activity out of, which would be great. I've got some nice bar/string things going, but I'm going to have a proper sit-down-and-think-it-through session sometime.<br /><br />Other than that, I can't really think of much. Bullar and Ingram came up to visit over the weekend which was cool, although they missed the best bit of <a href="http://www.corporation.org.uk">Corporation</a> (the main room on a Saturday night) since it didn't open until midnight ( :( ) and by that time Bullar was being his usual drunken self (ie. not taking no for an answer when asking if he can just go to sleep on the pavement after getting carried out of Corporation by the securty people) so Ingram took him home. Ah well.<br /><br />I may update more freqently now, since I will have little else to do in rural Cheshire.
