title: Hydra
---

This year I finally entered the 21st century by procuring a new fangled
(actually about 4-year-old) 64bit desktop. This was to use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) (which doesn't work well on 32bit machines),
since I need to run
[a particular project](https://github.com/TheoryMine/IsaPlanner) which comes
with a 'dockerfile'.

I though this would be a good opportunity to try out
[Hydra](https://nixos.org/hydra/) again, after previously struggling to make it
run on my laptop.

Whilst there are instructions available to [make Hydra run on
Ubuntu](https://nixos.org/wiki/Installing_Hydra_on_Ubuntu) (which this
desktop was running), they're very imperative and non-Nix-like.

Instead, I installed [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) on Ubuntu, and used that to
install [NixOps](https://nixos.org/nixops). I then used a great
[Hydra tutorial](https://github.com/peti/hydra-tutorial) to get everything
running in a couple of virtual machines.

This worked, but was quite limited regarding multi-core CPU usage, redundant
copies of Nix stores, and RAM overhead.

Last week, I decided to bite the bullet and install [NixOS](http://nixos.org/)
alongside Ubuntu on the desktop's bare metal, and after a few issues with WiFi
dongles (which I had *no* trouble with on Ubuntu; well done Canonical!), I've
managed to get a nice, clean Hydra service running, managed by systemd,
configured as a NixOS module, making good use of all of the available resources

:)
