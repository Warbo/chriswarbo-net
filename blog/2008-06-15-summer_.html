title: SUMMER!
---
I set my goals higher everyday<br />I make my own rules that I will obey each moment as long as I live<br />This is the life I was born to lead<br />Unique chance for me to express myself<br />And fulfill my dreams<br />I'm in control of this ship of mine<br />And everything will be just fine<br />Like the wind I'm free to go anywhere<br />I got my song, it dances in the air<br />Now I know what I'll do with my life<br />Now you will hear my freedom call<br /><br />All those bad times I've had in my life<br />Change into blessings if I change the point of view<br />I needed them to grow<br />I've changed so much<br />I'm finally free<br />To do what I want<br />Without any fear and guilt<br />It's so amazing<br />I'm in control<br />Like the wind<br /><br />-- Freedom by Stratovarius<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-3477045470415681568?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
