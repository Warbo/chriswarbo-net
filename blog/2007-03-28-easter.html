title: Easter

<span style="font-family: arial;">Woah, a long time since I posted! I thought I'd say what I've been up to and have in the works:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;"><p>* It is currently the Easter break, so I am at home in busy-busy Sandbach</p><br /><br /></span><span style="font-family: arial;"><p>* I am going a bit crazy brainstorming ideas that the FSS can act on (we will hold a meeting soon after getting back to Sheffield)</p><br /><br /></span><span style="font-family: arial;"><p>* The latest assignment from my COM162 Java course is to simulate a pinball machine.... Well, I am currently going a little crazy with my Physics knowledge to create an elaborate, general purpose physics engine which I can then shove values in to make a pinball table (I actually hope to let it read some kind of XML syntax in the future, and thus define tables (or whatever else it is used for) easily). Since it is an assignment which is testing my ability to understand object oriented programming I must do this myself, but after its use in my course is over rest assured I will make it publicly available as Free Software</p></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;"><p>Oh, and it may be a little late, but go on:</p><br /><br /></span><span style="font-family: arial;"> <br /><div align="center"></div></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;"> <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/actions/open_letter/steve_jobs"></a></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;"> <img src="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/files/images/steve_jester_jobs_200px.gif" /></span>
