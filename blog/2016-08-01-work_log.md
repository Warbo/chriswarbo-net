Enable profiled haskell packages, to investigate space leaks. Taking a while to build!

Looked at IsaPlanner docker file, since Nix builders don't seem to be able to call Docker (`nixbld` users aren't in the `docker` group); easier to reimplement in Nix than to fiddle around getting Docker to work.

 - isabelle: tarball, get with `fetchurl`
    - isaplib: github repo
     - isaplanner: github repo

Isabelle bundles its own Java, bu it needs patching to avoid `/lib` hard-coding, and shared library paths.

`nixpkgs.isabelle` has patches which work :)

Made a `profiledHaskellPackages`, got it built by Hydra, used it to cut down memory usage of ML4HSFE.
