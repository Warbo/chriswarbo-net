Using `src` rather than `${myDerivation}`, in combination with *disabling* distributed builds in hydra's nix config, has got hydra building derivations.

So far, I've made `release.nix` contain the custom haskell packages, as direct elements of the resulting set, i.e. `import release.nix` gives

    { haskell-ghc784-ASTPlugin-0.0.1        = <drv>;
      haskell-ghc784-ArbitraryHaskell-0.2.1 = <drv>;
      ... }

Tried overriding all Haskell package sets, but some are marked as broken (e.g. GHC 6.*). After removing those, Hydra got `OutOfMemory` evaluating the jobset; i.e. determining what the jobs/pkgs are, let alone building them. If we only include, say, GHC 7.8.4, the jobset evaluates and the packages start building. They take a while, as we need to build GHC, glibc, GCC, etc.

This may be taking longer than necessary by using `stable.haskellPackages`. If we treat `stable` as just another source of Haskell versions, we could split up some of the work.

Would be a good idea to make an i686 VM for building with too.

Made `mudraw` alias for `mutool draw` so Emacs can read PDFs.

Started 'report', empty for now :(

Used `packageOverrides` in haskell-te, caused some conflicts as names like `check` were already in use. Switched out their names.

Pushed changes to te-benchmarks to not only remove usage of nix-shell shebangs, but also put a wrapper around `full_haskell_pkg.sh` in `bin/`. This allows nix-build/hydra to run `full_haskell_pkg.sh` without getting confused by `/usr/bin/env` (`stdenv.mkDerivation` runs `patchShebangs` after installation).

Using mysql for replacing strings util seems to be a bit overkill; it's bringing in all sorts of dependencies.

Blog idea: Beyond reproducibility.

If our build environment is known (e.g. a Nix build process), can we partially-apply/supercompile our code?

E.g. we know which executable `bash` refers to, so feed in the script now and supercompile the pieces.

---

Removed mysql dependency; code is much slower (100% CPU on bash).

Maybe the haskell module should be its own'package'; we can at least get Hydra to build it.

Haskell packages seem to be building, although I was forced to do a garbage collection on `hydra-master`, as it ran out of space. Freed up ~500MB.

Disk image is 10GB, which comes from nixops default image. Tried adding a 100GB disk, but it shows as `sdb` and hence won't help with running out of space. There's a pull request for NixOps to honour resizing of disk images, but it's not merged yet.

_Priorities:_

 - Test `reduce-equations` on suctom types
 - Test cluster numbers appear in features
