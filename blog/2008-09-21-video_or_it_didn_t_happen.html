title: Video or it didn't happen
---
I've made a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-392484877146287942">screencast</a> to show some functionality that PubSubClient provides. Doesn't play in SWFDec at the moment, so you might have to use something like <a href="http://keepvid.com/">this</a>. I accept Google Video's terms of use, but not YouTube's.<br /><br />The video shows the Browser test application being used to find the nodes on a server and their sub-nodes, add and delete nodes, and add and remove node owners. I've been busy tonight, so that the display issues which cause me to close and reopen windows to show updates are fixed, I've got the Owners functionality working for Publishers and Outcasts too, and I'm mulling over a Subscriptions tab in the node properties (awkward since it may involve message stanzas, not just iq stanzas), generating the contents of the Metadata tab dynamically based on what's defined and changing the access model and other configuration options (awkward since it involves requesting, submitting and cancelling XMPP forms).<br /><br />For now though, I'm getting tired so it'll have to wait.
