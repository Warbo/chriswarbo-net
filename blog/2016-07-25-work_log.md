Screw bash substitution; use Python, it's much faster. Perl would be even faster, but I'm not a Perl monk :(

Regarding 2 prior issues:

 - Adding `builtins.unsafeDiscardStringContext` to `runScript` seems to appease Hydra and `eval.sh` regarding strings referring to store paths.
 - `NIX_REMOTE` command output wasn't being read. We were doing `NIX_REMOTE=/nix/store/...-result` rather than `NIX_REMOTE=daemon`
