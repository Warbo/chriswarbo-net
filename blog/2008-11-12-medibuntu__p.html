Just <a href="http://www.vuntz.net/journal/2008/10/28/495-medical-gnome">read</a> that the one of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> project's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free Software</a> desktops, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, is being used in a <a href="http://www.supersonicimagine.fr/product_0_6_aixplorer,en.htm">new machine</a> which uses flesh elasticity to find breast cancer. That's an awesome reason to hack on Free Software, since its impact on the world literally IS saving lives :)<br /><br />The company, SuperSonicImagine, aren't just (ab)using Free Software because it's royalty free, like <a href="http://www.apple.com/">many companies</a> do. They use the Cairo vector imaging library, amongst others, in their own software and contribute patches back upstream so everyone benefits from their improvements :)<br /><br />Also, if you're in a recent version of KDE 4, try opening the Akregator feed reader, opening some Web pages in its embedded Konqueror part, open Epiphany, then drag a tab from Akregator over the panel entry for Epiphany until it switches, then drop the tab into epiphany and watch it open. Pretty nice integration going on :D<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-804699862972258947?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
