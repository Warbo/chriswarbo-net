Some scripts not givingutput :(

Conflicts when adding multiple copies of a haskell pkg to an environment.

Raw output of TIP isn't accepted by `isabelle console`, need to comment out some breaking definitions.

Running Isabelle is a bit of a pain.

From the console of build scripts:

    echo 'use_thy "A";' | isabelle console

This will load/build `A.thy`

For IsaPlanner, add `-d /path/to/contrib/IsaPlanner` and `-l HOL-IsaPlannerSession` to use the augmented logic.

Trying the IsaCoSy examples, requires (or seems to) embedding ML code into the `.thy` file using `ML {* ... *}`
