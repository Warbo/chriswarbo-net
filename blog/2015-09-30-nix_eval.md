title: nix-eval
---

Today I made my first ever Hackage release, for [`nix-eval`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nix-eval). It's a little package which sprang out of the work I've been doing in Haskell metaprogramming. I've written up [some example usage](/essays/nixos/nix_eval.html), and hope it's useful to someone!
