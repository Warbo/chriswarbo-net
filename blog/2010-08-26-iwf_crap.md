title: IWF Crap
---
Seems the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation">Internet Watch Foundation</a> are at it again! Sub-domains of <a href="http://www.webs.com/">Webs.com</a> are currently inaccessible to anyone in the UK who's ISP pays attention to the IWF. This means that I am being blocked from visiting <a href="http://chriswarbo.webs.com/">my own Web site</a> because it contains child porn (the only reason the IWF blocks sites). Hmm. You can visit it via its old address <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/chriswarbo">here</a> and judge for yourself how much is illegal pornography, or you can visit it through <a href="http://proxy.org/cgi_proxies.shtml">a non-UK proxy</a>. Annoyingly the <a href="http://www.tk/">www.tk</a> servers won't let me change the redirect address of <a href="http://www.chriswarbo.tk/">www.chriswarbo.tk</a>. I think it may have expired :'( If you think this is ridiculous then do what I do, support the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org">Open Rights Group</a> :)<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/THZifh9ji5I/AAAAAAAAANA/CaPtCYv8PUQ/s1600/virgin%2Bkiller.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5509699487966399378" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/THZifh9ji5I/AAAAAAAAANA/CaPtCYv8PUQ/s320/virgin%2Bkiller.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 319px; height: 320px;" /></a>
