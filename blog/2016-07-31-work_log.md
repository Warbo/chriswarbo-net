Re-enabled criterion, causing some tests to fail.

Clustering can fail due to memory issues. This is probably a simple case of `String` in Haskell instead `Text`/`ByteString`. Possibly a memory leak too.

Benchmark with `weigh`; use profiling to find space leaks (maybe follow Neil Mitchell's advice?)
