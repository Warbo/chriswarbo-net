Added env var `NIX_EVAL_EXTRA_IMPORTS` which adds extra packages & modules to `reduce-equations`'s use of `nix-eval`.

For example:

    NIX_EVAL_EXTRA_IMPORTS='[("my-pkg","MyMod")]'

This should be moved to `nix-eval`, as well as `reduce-equations`' use of `TypedExpr`.

We use this new variable to set `NIX_EVAL_EXTRA_IMPORTS='[("tip-benchmark-sig", "A")]'` since that contains our tip-derived types.

Got `mlspecBench` to run, although `reduce-equations` doesn't output JSON :(

We can cross that bridge if/when we come to it.

For now priorities are:

 - Get Hydra to pass haskell-te tests (i.e. ensure there are no regressions)
 - Do sampling of tip:
    - We can do this 'once and for all' and store the results, rather than running a pipeline.
    - We need to sample some sizes. How about: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, ...?
    - We should take multiple samples; ask Alison what's appropriate?
