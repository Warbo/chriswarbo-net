title: Resits Over
---
Now it's in the hands of the Gods (by which I mean, of course, the Scientists). There's nothing I can do to change the outcome now, but I at least hope that nobody seriously pisses them off before they get marking.<br /><br />COM166 wasn't too bad. It was actually the same paper as the first time from what I could tell, but the papers had to be left behind. PHY203 was allowed to be taken away after the exam, thus they had a different paper for the resit. Weirdly I seemed better at the statistical mechanics (Boltzmann distributions, partition functions and the like, but sadly not so much with the statistical weighting of macrostates and its relation to entropy :( Yes, I know <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Zentralfriedhof_Vienna_-_Boltzmann.JPG">the formula</a>, but just couldn't articulate its relation to microstate counting very well) than some of the thermodynamics, even though I left it very late with the statistical revision. Meh, probably it was fresher in my mind.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. They're gone now and I'm confident I've passed, but obviously we live in a Universe who's determinism is a matter of debate. I may have done slightly better had I not been listening to the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php%3Fid%3D194">BRAT</a> game music playing over and over in my head on the way into the exam, and a subconscious yet rather annoying repetition of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Kung+Foo+Fighting">"WOOOOOHOHOHOOOOOAAA!"</a> about half way through. Yes, my head is weird. m8.<br /><br />Now I can carry on exactly what I was doing before, but this time not feel so guilty about wasting time :P &lt;/joking&gt;<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-6105081366023380478?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
