title: Nix Hacks
---

I've been using Nix and NixOS for a few years now, and it's really useful for
building, combining and orchestrating things.

Over this time I've come up with a few tricks and hacks, many of which turned
out to be a bad idea, but some of which are really useful and I use all over the
place to this day. These are mostly in [my git repos](/projects/repos),
especially [my Nix configuration repo](/projects/repos/nix-config.html); but
since those may change in the future, I've just created [a new page showing off
a bunch of these hacks](/projects/nixos/useful_hacks.html) with the Nix
expressions themselves, a little explanation and examples.

I hope it's useful to someone (most likely, me in the future!) :)
