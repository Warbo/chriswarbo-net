Benchmarking IsaCoSy on Naturals using `bench`.

Plan for today: Have Naturals benchmarked, equations formatted to JSON, built by Hydra.

Use `bench` to benchmark IsaCoSy; need to add

    export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LOCALE_ARCHIVE="${glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale-archive"

To prevent Unicode issues in Haskell and Perl.
