title: Action on the FSS Front
---
<span style="font-family: arial;">OK, I'm trying to get my ass in gear: We are having an FSS social some time in the next week (looks like Monday at the moment, although Harriet can't make Mondays :( . Every day will be a compromise, so we need to find the best compromise). We're also having a formal meeting some time (depends on responses on our forum and to our email account).</span><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />I want to run an installfest, and we might be hosting some LUG meetings in a bit. I'm going to whore myself out for memberships in Physics and Computer Science too, plus as many of my friends as I can.</p><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />If you haven't done so already then please join our <a href="http://fss.union.shef.ac.uk/forum">forum</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-4278802319743409203?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
