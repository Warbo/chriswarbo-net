title: A Few Site Updates
---

So it appears that [tidy](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5) has been updated
for HTML5, so I've added it as a
[test](/git/chriswarbo-net/git/branches/master/tests/tidy_html5.raw.html) for
this site.

In the process, I've fixed a bunch of dodgy HTML in old pages, and finally got
READMEs to render in [my git repositories](/projects/repos/).

I've also been adding a few [IndieWeb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) technologies
to this site, e.g. adding [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)
details to my [blog posts](/blog/). Hopefully I'll soon have feeds working,
which has been on my TODO list for a while!
