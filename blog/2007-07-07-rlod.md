<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6275728.stm">Red Lights Of Death</a>. All I can say is ROFL.

In other news, *sniff* oh God, *sob*... I can't even bring myself to... *blows nose* a <a href="http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html">rights abusing media whore</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6276682.stm">might have to think of something new to keep the money rolling in!</a> I don't think I can even begin to feel the hardship and suffering she must be going through right now. What a cruel world this is.

PS: I wrote this from within the bollock-licking Blogger.com interface, which has now decided that letting me write something in the "Title" field is obviously asking too much.
