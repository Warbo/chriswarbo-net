Fixed stack overflow issue. Lots of tests passing, and removed a bunch of cruft.

Hopefully will get tests passing today. Can then work on:

 - IsaPlanner table
 - `reduce-equations` types (hardcode for now)

`clustered` attribute seems to have empty `stdout`.

TIP seems to accept our combined smtlib benchmark and turn it into Isabelle wihout complaining.

Just need to invoke IsaCoSy and IsaScheme on it now.

Our benchmark issue might come from `nix-eval` using the default `haskellPackages`.

Check if our `<nixpkgs>` override is being used, by adding a `trace`.
