Just found this baby:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/S8M6ViE4-0I/AAAAAAAAAM4/O81GT8YU3Ao/s1600/recycled.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5459271314902154050" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/S8M6ViE4-0I/AAAAAAAAAM4/O81GT8YU3Ao/s320/recycled.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 256px;" /></a>Either it's a recycled PDF, or it's prescient about how I'm going to print it off.<br /><br />Unfortunately only 23.4% of this blog post is recycled.
