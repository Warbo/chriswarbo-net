title: Procedural Images
---

One of the first things I did after switching my site to an
[active code](/projects/activecode/) system was to create some pretty pictures.
These were mainly an excuse to experiment with shell-based active code, and work
out a decent workflow, rather than to provide a deep treatment of the algorithms
involved.

They've now done their job, but in case anyone finds them interesting I've moved
them out of my playground and into the [projects](/projects/) section:
[Procedural Pictures](/projects/procedural/)
