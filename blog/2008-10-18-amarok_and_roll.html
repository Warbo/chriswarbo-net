title: Amarok and roll
---
Just installed Amarok 2 via the Neon nightly build service (for Kubuntu, but still works on Debian Unstable :D ). I have to say, it is absolutely teh awesome! It really shows what KDE 4's "pillars" can do when used in combination.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I've used Amarok 2 before. However, the first time I tried it it kept crashing and didn't have much functionality. My attempts since have been greeted with a feature-packed player, which couldn't actually add anything to the playlist other than Internet radio streams :( With the nightlies it seems to be rocking full steam ahead, and doesn't take up too much space either :)<br /><br />The only problem currently is that the Qt it uses doesn't seem to have antialiasing enabled for text, but that's a very minor issue.<br /><br />Now to get Nepomuk to run without making my machine crawl. Perhaps the Java backend would make it work faster?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-3999959539328390677?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
