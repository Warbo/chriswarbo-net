Added a bunch of checks to the benchmark scripts (`withTime` and `withCriterion`) to make them check for required Haskell packages, and abort if not found. Removed `fallback` GHC we were adding to environment in `withNix`, so errors were forced.

Also modularised the benchmark scripts, to take out a bunch of duplicated functionality.

Hitting stack overflow on some tests; possibly due to annotation phase (dump seems to work).
