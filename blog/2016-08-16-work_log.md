`ML4HSTechReport` builds; just needs data.

IsaCoSy running with `Nat` theory. Need to run it with TIP (first the gutted export; then automatically gut the export).

Working in jEdit; trying from console.

Make table for Nats and Lists:

IsaCoSy   | HipSpec   | ML4HS
---------------------------------
X%        | Y%        | Z%
X seconds | Y seconds | Z seconds

_What have we done so far?_

ML4HS pipeline:

    Haskell pkg -> Clusters -> Equations

TIP definitions:

    TIP benchmarks -> SMTlib combination --+-> Haskell pkg
                                           |
                                           +-> Isabelle

IsaCoSy script:

    Theory (hard coded :( ) -> Equations

Stumbling on connecting TIP haskell pkg to ML4HS. Connecting TIP Isabelle to IsaCoSy needs to be done.

Emailed Omar asking about IsaScheme.

Thinking about the current haskell-te setup, it's a bit weird. Nix for tests is fine, but why for plumbing the components together?

Maybe we should have the Nix take in parameters (cluster number, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, etc. [maybe just inherit these from runtime?]) and spit out a single, self-contained script, which logs times and everything.

How would that look?
