Got haskell-te tests mostly running (there are a few hundred, and it gets to about 150 before aborting).

One issue: taking a package src directory in `explore` (for use as `standalone`, to ensure we have needed deps) was failing since src dirs usually don't contain `default.nix` (TIP benchmarks are the exception).

Added a call to `nixedHsPkg` (which I extracted from `nixFromCabal`) to ensure it's made if it doesn't already exist.

Clustering is killed for `list-extras`, as it takes more than 1GB of RAM. I've increased the cutoff of the `timeout` command to allow up to 2GB instead.

Rough plan:

Some TIP-based haskell-te tests were failing since they were looking for equations from 1 cluster; we *know* this is a bad idea, and we *want* it to fail; if it didn't, we could run it quite happily without clustering!

I've turned this into a check that we *should* run out of memory; we compare the value reported by `timeout` to that which we gave it as a limit.

Wrote `resize-vdi.sh` to find Hydra's virtual HD file (`.vdi`), check its size to see whether it's 100GB, and if not to `nixops stop`, resize it, then `./deploy.sh`. THis gives us a 100GB (virtual) disk, but we still need to update the partition table and grow the ext4 filesystem (can do this with GParted).

IsaPlanner: How to run TIP?

We can run arbitrary scripts via:

    docker run /bin/bash < foo

Attempt 1: Run `docker build` command in `buildPhase` of IsaPlanner; provide wrapper around `dcker run` in `bin/`

 - This requires docker to be running as a system service.

Attempt 2: Add `virtualisation.docker.enable = true` to `hydra-common.nix`

Setting `services.hydra.useSubstitutes` is MUCH faster than building our own!

We should have the failure of 1-cluster TIP exploration cached, it it isn't already...
