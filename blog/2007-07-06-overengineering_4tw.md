<span style="font-family: arial;">I know Rhythmbox can display notification bubbles when it starts playing a song, but it has been hit and miss for m (using Enlightenment 0.16 as a window manager can sometimes be troublesome :( ), but after getting the Mugshot software working (as far as I can tell) I have been getting notifications. Rhythmbox is telling last.fm my song, and Mugshot is picking up on that and telling me. Pretty nifty, if a little OTT!</span>
