title: Dodgy Chargers
---

Yesterday my laptop charger was sparking, so I pushed the power lead more snugly
into the adapter and it stopped. When I got home, it did the same, but seemed to
be pretty firmly connected, so I unplugged it from the mains and took the power
lead out of the adapter: one of the connector pins came out with it!

It seems that the dodgy connection wasn't with the external cable, but
*internally* in the unit. After much fannying about, I've ordered a replacement
from Amazon, and in the mean time I've gone back to my previous charger; which
has patched-together wires and is held together with duck tape!

I did try to open up the charger to see if I could reconnect the pin, but I
couldn't prise open the case. I did notice a quality control sticker on it
though: it passed inspection in August 2016...
