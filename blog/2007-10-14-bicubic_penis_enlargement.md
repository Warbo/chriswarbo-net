<span style="font-family: arial;">I'm sending this from the wonderous world of dialup Internets. Be Un Limited have awful customer service, I really mean it. I think I'm going to send them a letter by snail mail complaining about their email response, although knowing my luck the postage will be astronomical since it'll be to Bangalore. Which reminds me, I must post Loz's two sets of bike lock keys home...</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;">In other business the </span><a href="http://fss.union.shef.ac.uk" style="font-family: arial;">FSS</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> is running its own </span><a href="http://fss.union.shef.ac.uk/forum" style="font-family: arial;">forum</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> now (since MyFreeForum have policies which suck like a Dyson), and we should have a mailing list sooner rather than later if Billy from </span><a href="http://access-space.org/" style="font-family: arial;">Access Space</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> is able to help us set up the box I took down to be a server.

Soon though....</span>
