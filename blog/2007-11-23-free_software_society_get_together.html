<span style="font-family: arial;">Not a real meeting as such, not quite a release party, basically we're just having a bit of a meet up in BarOne. I'm currently downloading an Ubuntu 7.10 CD image, but it says it will take at least another 4 hours, which basically makes me unable to offer any written CDs of them :( I hope someone takes along a CD or a laptop with an image, then I should have no problem copying it (as long as my CD drive doesn't go all silly). I'll take along some Fedora and Debian CDs and stuff, so at least I'll be able to offer something.</span><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Oh well... /listens to LUGRadio</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-7089986380165510241?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
