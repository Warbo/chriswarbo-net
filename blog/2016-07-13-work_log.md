We could learn a compact representation of a generative model; already dont with e.g. graphs.

For each symbol S(i) assign probabilities P(i, 0), P(i, 1), etc.

Initial model: P(S(i)) = P(i, 0)

Expand:

    λv(i) -> <term>
    <term> <term>
    case <term> of
      <pat> -> <term>
      ...

Not the brillest; how about Church Encoding?

~~ `λs0 s1 s2 ... -> <term>` ~~

For n symbols:

    term n = λ s1 s2 ... sn -> <expr n>

    expr n = vi | 0 <= 1 < n
           | λ -> <expr (S n)>
           | <expr n> <expr n>

What can we compare recurrent clustering to?

 - Non-recurrent clustering
 - Simpler feature extraction/distance, e.g. n-grams, bag-of-words, tree kernel

Ranking would be good too; select first N closest matches.

We want to learn a rule from 𝒫(Def) -> 𝒫(Def) (in general). Maybe more practical for 𝒫(Def) -> Def -> [0,1]
