title: Overengineering 4TW

<span style="font-family: arial;">I know Rhythmbox can display notification bubbles when it starts playing a song, but it has been hit and miss for m (using Enlightenment 0.16 as a window manager can sometimes be troublesome :( ), but after getting the Mugshot software working (as far as I can tell) I have been getting notifications. Rhythmbox is telling last.fm my song, and Mugshot is picking up on that and telling me. Pretty nifty, if a little OTT!</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-7755422770070364161?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
