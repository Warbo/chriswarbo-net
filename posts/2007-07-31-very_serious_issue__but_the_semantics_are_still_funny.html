<span style="font-family: arial;">I was looking through my news aggregator today and came upon </span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6286698.stm" style="font-family: arial;">this BBC news story</a><span style="font-family: arial;">. Whilst it is a very serious issue I couldn't help being amused by the one line summary in the RSS feed:</span><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />"China executes the former head of its food and drug watchdog to death for corruption, state media says."</p><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Yes, it was such a severe punishment that he's not to be executed a little bit, nope he's to go the whole hog and be executed to death.</p><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Oh, and in case that story has ruined your happy mood <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTLO2F_ERY">here</a> is a nice video to get you back into your safe-by-security-theatre, I-can't-do-anything-about-this-stuff-because-I-have-been-trained-as-a-consumer-monkey-incapable-of-doing-anything-for-myself-so-that-companies-can-sell-me-basic-things-as-services so-called lives.</p><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Thank you</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-4046732538963612951?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
