title: You don't have to be into violent BDSM to think the GIMP Took Kit is sexy

<span style="font-family: arial;">I came across the </span><a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438" style="font-family: arial;">Aurora GTK2 engine</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> yesterday, and I have to admit that it is incredibly nice. Seriously. The attention to detail is staggering. It took me a while to find a </span><a href="http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/Daurora?content=65297" style="font-family: arial;">QT</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> </span><a href="http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/Domino+Kubuntu+package?content=52864&amp;PHPSESSID=cae" style="font-family: arial;">style</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> that I could severely tweak to sort of match it (for Kopete and Amarok, mostly), but after some fiddling I got it looking pretty consistent (although not perfect). I have filed </span><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/136854" style="font-family: arial;">a needs-packaging bug in Launchpad</a> about it, because it really is very nice. Unless there are technical flaws found in it I think it would be great as a default theme (note that the colour scheme is my own. Aurora is actually the first GTK engine I have seen that uses the recently.added recolouring support).<br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;">Here's a piccy for you:</span><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/RtxkQO_NN-I/AAAAAAAAABc/LL5IMQfHY7M/s1600-h/+Screen.png" style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5106066307595188194" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6BhjMzysLTs/RtxkQO_NN-I/AAAAAAAAABc/LL5IMQfHY7M/s400/+Screen.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: arial;">Also, some </span><a href="http://www.semanticmetadata.net/stuff/" style="font-family: arial;">image slicing</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> </span><a href="http://gabeiscoding.com/" style="font-family: arial;">GUIs</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> have been made, which is cool.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-8119736262420464461?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
