title: Why Are Physicists Bad In Bed?
---
Jo asked me this today. I came up with the following:<br />
<br />
Because a femtosecond is a long time to a Physicist.<br />
<br />
Because their length contracts when they go faster.<br />
<br />
Because the more energy they have, the shorter their time period.<br />
<br />
Because they can&#39;t solve the 3-body problem (thanks XKCD).<br />
<br />
Because they don&#39;t know what goes on inside black holes.<br />
<br />
Because they&#39;re not MACHOs.<br />
<br />
Because they&#39;re a Bohr.<br />
<br />
Because they can&#39;t carry any force when they&#39;ve got a fermion.<br />
<br />
Because their oscillations lose energy quickly when damped.<br />
<br />
Because they tend to Bragg.<br />
<br />
Because they follow the principle of least action.<br />
<br />
Because they find that repetitive motion Hertz.<br />
<br />
Because their Planck length is only <span class="st">1.6x10^-35 metres.</span><br />
<br />
and, saving the best until last:<br />
<br />
They&#39;re uncertain since someone interfered with their Young slit.
