Either do an in-depth character exploration, or do some mindless entertainment. This is neither.

Apparently this inanity goes on for two hours, so I'm off to read some more papers on programming language theory.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-4516952528218477095?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
