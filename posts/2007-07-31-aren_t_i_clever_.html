title: Aren't I Clever?

<span style="font-family: arial;">I was reading a few </span><a href="http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2189&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=17737#forumpost17737" style="font-family: arial;">forum threads</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> about </span><a href="http://aros.sourceforge.net/introduction/index.php" style="font-family: arial;">AROS</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> when I saw the topic of </span><a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com/" style="font-family: arial;">multi-touch screens</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> raised, with a link to </span><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EJIXKOEF3ER7VN5/?ALLSTEPS" style="font-family: arial;">an Intructables tutorial</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> for building one (with some </span><a href="http://www.multitouch.nl/" style="font-family: arial;">nice</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> </span><a href="http://nuigroup.com/" style="font-family: arial;">links</a><span style="font-family: arial;">). However, I read the guide and watched the video, but couldn't help thinking that there had to be a more accurate way of making one, so I sat down for 10 minutes with some paper and a pen and went through a few ideas. After dismissing some ideas which clearly aren't scalable I think I've actually come up with a pretty neat and easy solution. I'm obviously not going to detail its inner workings here, but I'll build a prototype as soon as I have time to do a little testing. Sheffield would probably be a good place to do this, since Sandbach isn't really known for its DIY/craft shopping scene.</span><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Oh by the way, stumbled along <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/">this</a> too.</p><p style="font-family: arial;"><br />Oh yeah.
