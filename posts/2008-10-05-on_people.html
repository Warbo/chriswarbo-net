title: On People

People are intelligent, sentient beings.<br /><br />If you try to deny the intelligence or sentience of any human being then I suggest you give me an incredibly wide berth.<br /><br />Sentience, in my mind, is the only thing of any value in the entire Universe. I don't give a crap how well you can recite Pi, or tell funny jokes, or how awesome you are at anything. If sentience is at stake, I'd bet you and I together in an effort to save it.<br /><br />For those who belittle the sentience of others, I severely wish you're being ironic, or you may meet an untimely end at my hands. Yes, that is a death threat, but laws don't mean anything compared to the continuation of sentience, so I would gladly accept whatever temporal punishment may be wrought against me in a fascism such as the UK if it means an ontherwise unobtainable continuation, or possible continuation, of sentience.<br /><br />Some people are crying out for bricks to reshape their skulls. However, such sentient beings are part of the solution, rather than the problem (for the time being), so the best course of action is to disassociate oneself with acts one finds disagreeable.<br /><br />I hope that offers some useful philosophy for someone, as it is useful to me.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2304809778837392812-7324852218798571520?l=seriously-this-is-not-worth-reading.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
