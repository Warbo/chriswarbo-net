title: Lambda Lounge Manchester

I discovered the [Manchester Lambda Lounge](http://www.lambdalounge.org.uk) yesterday and popped over to Manchester to take a look. There was a presentation on implementing monads and arrows in Scala, followed by some discussions in the pub.

I consider myself somewhat fluent with monads, although less-so with arrows since I've not used many arrow-based libraries, so I took it as a lesson in Scala using familar concepts, rather than a lesson in monads and arrows using a familiar language. I have to say that Scala doesn't look terrible for a JVM language, but it seems to suffer from Java's type system dragging it down. We couldn't quite work out a generic monad implementation which Scala's type system would accept. I've spent a bit of time mulling this over, which I'll put up in a separate post.

While chatting in the pub afterwards I met a fellow [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr) user, who's currently working through the [Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)](http://homotopytypetheory.org) book. He mentioned an interest in giving a future talk about Coq, which I was also thinking about doing. Since I'm a Coq n00b I've instead sent a message to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lambda-lounge-manchester) about doing a talk on [Idris](http://idris-lang.org), so we'll see if that materialises :)

PS: It did ;)
