title: Coherent units
---

A system of measurement is [coherent]() when it only contains *one* unit of
distance, *one* unit of force, *one* unit of pressure, and so on for each
distinct [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis).

The SI system is coherent, since it only has one unit of length (the metre),
one unit of time (the second), and so on. Those familiar with SI might disagree
with this statement at fist glance; after all, there are units like kilometres
and Pascals which introduce redundancy. However, those are merely *names*, used
This statement might seem wrong
are a couple of subtleties


For example, an "imperial" system containing more than one unit of distance
(say, both feet *and* inches)
