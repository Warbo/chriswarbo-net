title: Improving units and notation
---

Many of the systems and ideas we use every day, like the way we count and
measure things, were developed over centuries. They have managed to "stand the
test of time", which is certainly an advantage; but may also suffer from a form
of "historical inertia", which can prevent subsequent insights from gaining
traction.

For example, we still talk about 90°, 120° and 180° instead of ¼, ⅓ and ½ turns;
essentially because the Babylonians didn't have fractions 5000 years ago.
We also have redundant units like the tonne (Megagram); we waste time learning
tricky, niche concepts like subtraction and pseudovectors, rather than elegant,
more-general alternatives (e.g. negatives and rotors, in those cases).

These pages are my ongoing attempt to find such situations, and distill the
insights they provide into a more coherent approach to understanding the world.

Note that the truly important parts, the underlying ideas, are generally *not*
my own; although their presentation may be unorthodox, e.g. to avoid historical
baggage and focus on coherence. Many of these ideas will *not* be described in
full detail, or with the level of rigour some might desire; this is largely due
to my own ignorance, but also to focus on equipping individuals (mostly myself!)
with a 'core' of good ideas, which can be applied and extended in many
interesting directions.

## Units of Measure ##

First of all, the various unit systems known as "imperial" should burn in the
dumpster fire of history. [The metric system is *far* better](metric.html), but
[not for the reasons usually given](metric_red_herring.html).

Even better than metric, is the SI system (a refinement of metric, commonly used
by scientists, which takes the principles of metric measurement even further).

## Numbers ##

[The minus sign should be avoided](minus.html):

 - [Negatives are better written negative with a bar](negatives.html)
 - [Subtraction should be avoided](subtraction.html), in favour of adding a
   negative.
