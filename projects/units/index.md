[The metric system is pretty good](metric.html), but
[not for the reasons usually given](metric_red_herring.md). SI is even better

[The minus sign should be avoided](minus.html):

 - [Negatives are better written negative with a bar](negatives.html)
 - [Subtraction should be avoided](subtraction.html), in favour of adding a
   negative.
