title: Joining Parentheses
---

Parentheses are used to 'group together' parts of an expression; for example
$8 + ((3 + 2) \times (1 + 4))$. When many parentheses are nested, a common
problem is having to physically *count them* to figure out which ones match up;
or, in other words, to determine the extent of what's in them.

Prior to theuse of prentheses, it was common to use an over-bar (called a
'vinculum') to express grouping. This would render the above like:
$8 + \overbar{\overbar{3 + 2} \times \overbar{1 + 4}}$

The vinculum makes its extent more clear, since it is physically present above
its entire contents. However, I still appreciate the way parentheses 'split up'
their interior from their exterior. When I need to make heavy use of grouping
(e.g. calculating the tree-like expressions of combinatory logic) I will often
combine the benefits of both, by drawing 'joined parentheses'. These begin as an
ordinary open-parenthesis, but the corresponding closing~parenthesis will 'loop
back over' the contents to 'join up' with its partner
