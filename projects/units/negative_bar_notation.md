title: Bar Notation for Negation

</div>

There are many ways we can write down "negatives", or more general "negations"
(whose result may actually be positive!). The most common way is using
a "minus sign", e.g. $-5$ for the negative of $5$, but I think [minus signs are
too cumbersome and confusing](minus.html). Instead, I prefer to draw a line
*over the top* (often called a "bar"), rather than to the left.

For example, the negative of $5$ can be written $\ngtv{5}$, the negative of a
variable $x$ can be written $\ngtv{x}$, the negative of a sum $p + 43$ can be
written $\ngtv{p + 43}$, and so on.

This [bar notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline#Math_and_science)
is not original! Prior/similar uses include:

 - [Signed digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed-digit_representation)
   often use bars to indicate negatives.
 - Bars used for (logical) negation, (complex) conjugation, (set) complement,
   and other sorts of "inverses" (these are related, since negatives are
   [additive inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse))
 - [Wildberger](https://www.wildegg.com) advocates bar notation for negatives
   (e.g. in their [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/njwildberger))

### Known Conflicts ###

Bar notation is also used for things which have nothing to do with negatives,
which makes for unfortunate clashes. Here are some I'm aware of:

**Please suggest more clashes!**

#### Repeating Decimals ####

Bars are sometimes used for repeating decimals, e.g. $1.\ngtv{23}$ to represent
$1.23232323\ldots$. Since [this varies between countries
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Notation), it can be avoided
in favour of a different notation.

#### p-adic Numbers ####

p-adic numbers have the same conflict as repeating decimals, except going to the
left instead of right. If we pick one of the other common notations for
repeating decimals, we should also use it for p-adic numbers, for consistency.

### Pronunciation ###

I propose sticking to the word "negative" when saying these quantities or
expressions out loud, rather than pronouncing the symbols (like "minus five" or
"five bar").

### Long and Short Bars ###

Consider a long expression like this:

$$x(2 + \ngtv{123.45 + \frac{42y^2}{7}} + 96)$$

The bar clearly shows which parts are negative, without needing more parentheses
(although we can add them if desired). For comparison, using minus signs would
give this:

$$x(2 + (-(123.45 + \frac{42y^2}{7})) + 96)$$

If we don't like such long bars, we can instead multiply by $\ngtv{1}$ (note
that this *still* require fewer parentheses than a minus sign):

$$x(2 + \ngtv{1}(123.45 + \frac{42y^2}{7}) + 96)$$

See below for more discussion of $\ngtv{1}$.

### Horizontal Alignment ###

Adding bars doesn't add any horizontal space, which makes it easier to align
things. For example, here's a small times-table:

<style type="text/css">
.times-table {
 border-collapse: collapse;
 margin: auto;
}

.times-table > * > tr > th:first-child {
 border-right:black solid 1px;
}

.times-table > thead > tr > th {
 border-bottom:black solid 1px;
}

.times-table td, .times-table th {
 padding: 0.2em 0.3em;
}
</style>
<table class="times-table" summary="Times table from 2X&#773; to 2"><thead>
 <tr class="even">
  <th>Ã—</th>
  <th scope="col">2&#x305;</th>
  <th>1&#x305;</th>
  <th>0</th>
  <th>1</th>
  <th>2</th>
 </tr>
</thead><tbody>
 <tr class="odd">
  <th scope="row">2&#x305;</th>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>2&#x305;</td>
  <td>4&#x305;</td>
 </tr>
 <tr class="even">
  <th>1&#x305;</th>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>1&#x305;</td>
  <td>2&#x305;</td>
 </tr>
 <tr class="odd">
  <th>0</th>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
 </tr>
 <tr class="even">
  <th>1</th>
  <td>2&#x305;</td>
  <td>1&#x305;</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr class="odd">
  <th>2</th>
  <td>4&#x305;</td>
  <td>2&#x305;</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

This seems like a minor quibble, but grids of numbers/expressions are used all
over the place: spreadsheets, long addition/multiplication, matrices, etc.
Place-value numbers *themselves* are a grid of digits, which makes bar notation
so attractive when using [negative digits](negative_digits.html).

Bars add a *little* vertical space to an expression, but only the *thickness* of
the bar (and some separation); in comparison, minus signs extend an expression
horizontally by their entire *length* (plus separation).
