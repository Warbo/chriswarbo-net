Theory exploration is a research interest of mine. It's also known as/related to
conjecture synthesis/generation, and complements things like
automated/interactive theorem proving, concept invention, etc.

Some links:

 - [Theory exploration benchmarks](/projects/repos/theory-exploration-benchmarks.html)
   This is a project to measure and compare the performance of different TE
   systems on a standard problem set.
