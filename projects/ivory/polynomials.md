TODO

 - Extend `univariate-monomial` in a different way by summing them
 - Useful for approximating behaviour/functions. Mention Chebyshev polynomials,
   spread polynomials, etc.
 - Mention rational expressions as better-behaved when far away; mention Taylor
   series (and "on-sequences") as iteratively approximating to arbitrary
   precision, but having undecidable equality/normal-form
 - Introduce differentiation by evaluating at `v+d`: polynomials are closed
 - How to introduce integration? As anti-derivative?
