TODO

 - Exponents let us implement reciprocals (powers of 1̅), and hence fractions
 - Exponents interact with each other and with products, but not sums
   - This page should focus on their normalisation rules, as an extension to the
     sums-and-products page
   - Normal form is likely to be the fixed point of
     'x = sums-of-products-of-exponents-of x'
 - Fractional exponents give us algebraic numbers; save that for the radical page
