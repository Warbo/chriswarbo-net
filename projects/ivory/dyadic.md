TODO:
 - `dyadic` numbers are finite binary decimals (i.e. an integer over a power of
   two)
   - Dyad refers to their two-ness; like triad is for three-ness
 - Dyadic numbers are a subset of decimals, where the numerators are powers of
   five (since 5/10 is 1/2)
 - Floating point numbers are a subset of `dyadic`
 - Closed under addition, multiplication, etc.
