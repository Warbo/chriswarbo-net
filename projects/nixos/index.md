title: NixOS
---

I'm very interested in the Nix package manager, NixOS Linux distribution and the
ecosystem that's emerging around them. As a seasoned user of Nix, I've written
some (opinionated) guides and explanations:

 - [Nix from the bottom up](bottom_up.html) explains the basic underpinnings of
   Nix, and what it's actually doing under the hood.
 - [Nixlang glossary](glossary.html) gives a rough overview of the Nix
   Expression Language, which can be used to specify what Nix should build.
 - [Nix Packages](packages.html) describes how Nix provides a similar
   user/sysadmin experience to a traditional Linux package manager.

Over the years I've come up with a few tricks/hacks, which may be useful to
some:

 - [Useful Nix hacks](useful_hacks.html)
 - [Using Debian Packages on NixOS](debian_packages.html)
 - [Scripting with Nix](scripting_with_nix.html)
 - [`nix-eval` for run-time evaluation of Haskell code](nix_eval.html)
 - [Benchmarking arbitrary projects with Nix and asv](asv_benchmarking.html)
 - [`nix-shell` shebangs](nix_shell_shebangs.html)
 - [Using Nix with separate stores](separate_nix_stores.html)
 - [Nix caching on a LAN](2024-01-23-nix_cache_on_lan.html)

I've also written some pages about various ways I've used Nix:

 - [Switching to NixOS](switching_to_nixos.html)
 - [Developing on NixOS](developing_on_nixos.html)
 - [Continuous Integration](continuous_integration.html)
