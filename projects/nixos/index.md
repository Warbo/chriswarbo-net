I'm very interested in the Nix package manager, NixOS Linux distribution and the
ecosystem that's emerging around them. As I've been learning my way around, I've
written up a few cool tricks.

 - [Switching to NixOS](switching_to_nixos.html)
 - [Developing on NixOS](developing_on_nixos.html)
 - [Useful Nix hacks](useful_hacks.html)
 - [Continuous Integration](continuous_integration.html)
 - [`nix-shell` shebangs](nix_shell_shebangs.html)
 - [`nix-eval` for run-time evaluation of Haskell code](nix_eval.html)
 - [Benchmarking arbitrary projects with Nix and asv](asv_benchmarking.html)
