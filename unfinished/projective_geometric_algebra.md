title: Projective Geometric Algebra
---

Projective geometry can be expressed using cross products (e.g. see https://youtu.be/puMYfJTFdgQ?t=964 )

Cross products are icky. Can we use geometric products instead?

Going further: projective geometry involves lines and points, which are dual/symmetric.
Geometric algebra doesn't involve points or (unbounded) lines; it starts with vectors.
What's the nicest way to capture these things? Is it by going to a higher dimension, like
the homogeneous coordinates of projective geometry (e.g. subspaces crossing a "viewing plane"?)?

(Conformal geometric algebra?)
