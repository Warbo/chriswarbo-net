title: Space-Filling Curves
---

Locality is important. The Hilbert curve is good for that.

## Loops ##

How can we coil up a loop, such that it doesn't cross itself and that in
2D/3D/etc. the edges loop around. How can we preserve locality across
dimensions?

## Brute-forcing ##

Can we brute-force small problems, and derive a general rule/pattern?
