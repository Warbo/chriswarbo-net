discussing whether questions in Physics could benefit from an intuitionistic
approach to mathematics. It's an interesting idea, but it's rather subtle; and
tripping over those nuanced details can lead us astray (or give us the wrong
intuition, so to speak).

In particular, Sabine focused on the idea of
[real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) and their "decimal
places", which is a useful model for introducing these ideas; but taking it too
far can result in some confusion. For example, something as simple as the number
⅓ may appear "infinitely complicated" when viewed as a never-ending decimal
0.333… On the other hand, using a different
[numerical base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix) can make it simple again
(e.g. in [dozenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal) it's just 0.4).

There *is* an important question lurking in the decimal places of real numbers,
but to understand it we can't "just" calculate or measure more digits.

### Algorithmic information theory ###

The finite/infinite distinction we should be making is not directly at the level
of decimal places, but more fundamentally at the amount of *information* present
in a number (or any other mathematical construct). Information is a *relative*
quantity, depending on how much it constrains an existing (or "prior")
probability distribution.

For computing the digits of a number, the relevant probability distribution is
over computations which give rise to those digits.

### Finitely representable ≠ finite decimal ###

Grouping numbers into finite decimals and infinite decimals doesn't take us far
enough. We need to split up those infinite decimals further, into those which
are rational (whose digits repeat) and those which are irrational; then we split
those irrationals into the algebraic   A phrase like "infinite decimal" can encompass many things, from the
otherwise-simple ⅓ to something as inscrutable as
[Chaitin's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant); similar
loose, rational or "irrational"
