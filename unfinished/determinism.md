Many-worlds takes the quantum nature of observers seriously. Superdeterminism
takes the determinism of observers seriously.

Don't know if either is right, but I never understood objections to determinism
based on Bell-like setups, e.g. "it can't be deterministic, since we hadn't yet
chosen which axis to measure!", but the whole point of determinism is that the
choice of axis is pre-determined (just like everything else).
