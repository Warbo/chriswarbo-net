Many-worlds takes the quantum nature of observers seriously. Superdeterminism
takes the determinism of observers seriously.

Don't know if either is right, but I never understood objections to determinism
based on Bell-like setups, e.g. "it can't be deterministic, since we hadn't yet
chosen which axis to measure!", but the whole point of determinism is that the
choice of axis is pre-determined (just like everything else).

What about far away influences, like choosing axes based on distant photons? If
we ignore the intervening space(time), then any 'conspiracy' between the
detector's choice of axes and the particle's choice of hidden variables would
have to occur within their intersecting light=cones
