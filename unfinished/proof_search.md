Norman Wildberger posted a video recently, demonstrating the problems which can
arise when treating never-ending processes as if they have a "result". He uses
the classic example of summing the numbers 2⁻ⁿ, with n counting up from 1. We
can write this as an imperative algorithm, e.g. in Python:

```python
total = 0
for n in
```
