title: Negative Digits
---

I find it *especially* pleasing when notations and concepts *coincide*: that is,
when some notation *appears* to have two conflicting uses, but turn out to both
mean the same thing!

As an example, bar notation is already used for
[negative digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed-digit_representation),
e.g. a number like $12\ngtv{3}4$ meaning
$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + \ngtv{3} \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0$ (the
number $1174$, with non-negative digits). With bar notation, the digits ($1$,
$2$, $\ngtv{3}$ and $4$) will always match the coefficients. We don't get that
with minus signs (where the digit $\ngtv{3}$ would give a coefficient $-3$).

There is also a more subtle coincidence between bar notation for negative digits
and negative numbers: if *all* of a number's digits are negative, that number
will be negative. As long as we "join together" the bars of neighbouring
digits, this coincides *exactly* with our negative number notation. For example,
an expression like $\ngtv{9876}$ can be interpreted *both* as the negative of $9876$
*and* as a number written with negative digits (representing $\ngtv{9} \times
10^3 + \ngtv{8} \times 10^2 + \ngtv{7} \times 10^1 + \ngtv{6} \times 10^0$);
they both refer to the same quantity!
