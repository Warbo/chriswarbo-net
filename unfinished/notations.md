title: Better Notations
---

These pages detail various alternative approaches to common tasks/areas in
science and mathematics. I've tried to split them into "standalone" parts, which
are useful to adopt on their own (those which work well together contain links).

These ideas aren't particularly original, but are generally simpler and more
consistent than the usual methods; and hence deserve to be more widely known,
and potentially used/taught instead of the complicated and baroque techniques we
tend to reach for.

## Numbers ##

 * Generalising place-value numbers to polynomials
 * Negative digits
 * Highly-composite bases
 * Non-decimal prefix abbreviations
 * Logarithmic number names

## Arithmetic ##

 * Negatives and reciprocals (instead of subtraction and division)
 * 3blue1brown power triangle

## Geometry ##

 * A(f)fine way to avoid geometric assumptions
 * From numbers to vector
 * Geometric algebra
 * Rational trigonometry

## Units of Measure ##

 * The metric red herring (why metric is *really* superior to imperial)
 * Problems with metric, which are solved by SI
 * Remaining problems with SI
 * Natural units
 * Units for rotation (turns, spread and circle constants)
