    # Some explanation of these options:
    #   --ignore-times because Nix sets them all to 1970
    #   --checksum uses file content to determine what's changed, in lieu of the
    #     timestamp
    #   --delete removes any files on the destination which aren't in the source
    #   --progress tells us what it's up to
    #   --copy-unsafe-links causes absolute symlinks (or relative ones pointing
    #     outside the source tree) to be dereferenced and copied as files/dirs
    #   --archive causes directories and (safe) symlinks to be copied, and
    #     permissions, etc. to be preserved
    #   -e forces SSH to use a TTY, so sudo will work
    #   --rsync-path tells us what to run on the remote end, in this case we use
    #     sudo so we've got permission to write to /var/www. NOTE: If you use an
    #     SSH passphrase, this might cause it to be sent in the clear! We use
    #     keys so it's not an issue.
    #   --exclude tells rsync to ignore a path, so it won't copy or delete it
    # Note that the trailing / after $DIR will cause its contents to be copied
