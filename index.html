  This is a place for me to collect thoughts and experiments, mostly around
  programming languages and artificial intelligence.

<p>
  Pages are organised into the following overlapping categories:
</p>

<h2><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a></h2>

<p>
  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINO">FINO</a> stack of rants, hacks,
  opinions, etc. Updated frequently but rarely revised.
</p>

$partial("templates/post-list.html")$

<h2><a href="/essays.html">Essays</a></h2>

<p>
  A collection of thought-out, carefully managed articles and demos.
  Infrequently updated, but hopefully accurate.
