## ChrisWarbo.net

This is the source for chriswarbo.net. To render the site, you will need the
[Nix package manager](http://nix.nixos.org). Once you have Nix, you can render
everything using:

```
./render
```

This will fetch all dependencies, then call GNU Make to build the site. Options
to the `render` script will be sent to `make`, so you can use all of the usual
tricks (eg. `-j 8` to build 8 things in parallel).

The site itself will be created in a directory called `rendered`. For example,
if you just want to build `blog.html`, you can call:

```
./render rendered/blog.html
```

This will also build all of the dependencies, eg. the contents of the
`rendered/blog/` directory.

A few special commands are available too:

 - `all` will build all the the contents of `rendered/`. This is the default.
 - `clean` will delete `rendered/`.
 - `test` will build the site, then run the scripts in `tests/`
 - `copy` will test the site, then copy it to the chriswarbo.net
   server (which you will presumably have no access to).
 - `push` will copy the site, then point the server to the new version.
