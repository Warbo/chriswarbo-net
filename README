## ChrisWarbo.net

This is the source for chriswarbo.net. To render the site, you will need the
[Nix package manager](http://nix.nixos.org). Optionally, you can also install
[IPFS](http://ipfs.io) to host the resulting site.

You can render everything using:

```
./render <arg>
```

Running `./render` without an argument will tell you the various arguments
available.
