## ChrisWarbo.net

This is the source for chriswarbo.net. To render the site, you will need the
[Nix package manager](http://nix.nixos.org). Optionally, you can also install
[IPFS](http://ipfs.io) to host the resulting site.

You can render everything using:

```
./render <arg>
```

Running `./render` without an argument will tell you the various arguments
available.

### IPNS

Publishing this site on IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is easy, but each
version will get a different address (based on a hash of its contents).
Optionally, we can use IPNS (Inter-Planetary Name System) to 'update' an
existing address to a new version. This is based on asymmetric encryption, so an
address can only be updated by those with the corresponding private key.

Each IPNS private key has an associated "name"; this doesn't affect the address
or contents, it just makes it more convenient to call IPFS commands, since we
can specify a key by name instead of its pseudo-random content. We assume the
existence of keys with certain names; if you don't want these "polluting" your
main IPFS node, you could run a separate node just for this purpose.

In particular there should be a key named `chriswarbonet`, which we will use to
publish the main site. Additionally, each git repo will have its own key, named
the same as the repo (but without the `.git` suffix); for example a git repo
`foo-bar.git` will be published to the key `foo-bar`.

To generate a key for a go-ipfs node, the following command can be used:

    ipfs key gen --type=rsa --size=2048 the-desired-name
